# Project Description

Ebb is a Travel Blog/Journal to share user experiences and insights to their favorite destinations. 
# General Approach
I set the MVP foundation for how the backend will interact with the frontend in regards to components and models. As I progress through this project I plan on being flexible with the structure of this application for front-end and which models will have all crud functionality.

# User Stories
As a regular Ebb app user, I want to share my traveling experiences with others and explore new adventures through others. Having a place to jot down my experiences digitally allows me more accessibility to share and consume.
